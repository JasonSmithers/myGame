# myGame

Introduction
============

This is a simple game created using pygame. The player can move up, down, left and right on the keypad to avoid clashing with the enemy bots. Once you either avoid all bots or collect the token
you will win the game.

Where you can improve the game
==============================

* Simplify the code to be of a smaller size
* The bots sometime appear ontop of each other
* The bots appear in random positions sometimes to close to the player to have a chance to move.
